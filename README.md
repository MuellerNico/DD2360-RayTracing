# DD2360-RayTracing
Project work for DD2360 Applied GPU Programming. 

Based on: https://github.com/rogerallen/raytracinginoneweekendincuda

# Run in Google Colab

1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Select "GitHub" option on the left
3. Select this repository from the dropdown menu
4. Open the notebook `raytracing.ipynb`
5. Follow the steps there

Alternatively, instead of steps 1-3 you can also manually upload `raytracing.ipynb` to google colab and start from there. 

I suggest to not commit any changes from within the colab environment (it's technically possible) and only use it for running the code.
