# DD2360-RayTracing
Project work for DD2360 Applied GPU Programming. 

Based on: https://github.com/rogerallen/raytracinginoneweekendincuda

# Run in Google Colab

1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Select "GitHub" on the left
3. Select this repository from the dropdown menu (or paste it's link)
4. Open the notebook raytracing.ipynb
5. Follow the steps there

Alternatively, instead of steps 1-3 you can also manually upload the notebook to google colab and start from there. 

I suggest to not commit any changes from within the colab environment, even though it's possible, and only use it for running the code.
