Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads().

Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads().
